## An Unexpected Pivot

I never thought I would end up in data science. I hadn't even heard of data science until I stumbled across a bootcamp opportunity from my department's mailing list during my last year of graduate school. I took a look and it sounded interesting but best of all, it was free. So why the hell not - the only opportunity cost was my time.

## The Application Process

The application process took me ~60 hours to complete and was reasonably fun. There were two parts: a test-like portion that required analyzing a 10GB taxi dataset and an open-ended portion where you had to come up with a data science project and pitch it. The test portion was clearly a simple bar - if you could complete it that was good but wouldn't necessarily set you apart from other candidates. On top of that, the test portion was technically optional. So it became quite obvious that the differentiating factor would be the open-ended section.

At the time, I considered myself lucky because I only knew MATLAB which is awful at handling big data - but I was armed with an i7 and 64GB of RAM. I ended up brute-forcing my way through the test portion over a weekend. The open-ended part was a different story and took the majority of my time. I definitely spent a significant amount of time researching what makes a data science project good and trying to figure out how I could make my project stand out. I ended up with a project that coincidentally covered a few data science topics including web scraping and NLP.

And then I had to pitch my project. Since candidates were required to upload their pitch videos onto Youtube, I did my research to find some examples. I listened to a few pitches and after about five of them concluded that they were **boring AF**. All of them simply described what they did. Many started with "My project is about...", some went too technical, and none of them left any lasting impacts. I'm not an expert in elevator pitches, but pitches should be captivating and persuasive which is how I tried to build mine. So while this is an extremely small sample size of one, it must have worked to some degree because I ended up getting accepted.

## Whipped Into Shape

The bootcamp itself kicked my ass. I describe it as the most intense two months of my life, because in that time, I learned:

* SQL, Python, and Scala
* Web scraping
* Fundamentals of machine learning
* Basics of natural language processing
* Distributed computing, mapreduce and Spark
* Data visualization and web development
* Interview skills - interpersonal, coding, and case studies

Coming into the program with a background of MATLAB and a tiny bit of C++, it was brutal. For six continuous weeks, my day would begin at 9AM with an hour long lecture. Then I'd work on a variety of projects until 8PM. I’d go home, eat dinner, continue working until about 11PM, then get to bed. Rinse and repeat nearly every single day for two months straight. 

At the end of these trials and tribulations, only one person out of our little cohort of 10 in the Bay Area got hired by one of their partners and it was in Atlanta. But the knowledge that I gained from those weeks was incredible, and paved the way for the rest of my career. I look back and can’t fathom how I ended up surviving that hellish trial by fire, but I am definitely grateful that I had the opportunity to go through it.

Le	Chiem	Dear Mr. Le, <br> &emsp;Just wanted to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas! Thank you for everything you and your family has done for these past 4-5 years for me while I've been in Georgia. I've always felt that you were the glue that held our ALTA team together and made it so enjoyable! I wish you and your family the best in future endeavors and will be sure to give you a call if I'm ever in Atlanta!
Kien	Lam	Dear Kien+Vi, <br> &emsp;Thanks for being an awesome tennis buddy and friend for these past 4-5 years. Thursday nights and Saturday mornings were always something to look forward to for me, and it's always a pleasure hitting with somebody who loves the game as much as you do.Best of luck to the next big step in your life and hopefully many more victorious ALTA seasons! =D
Judy	Ho	Hi Mom! <br> &emsp; So since I didn't have time to write out Christmas cards, I thought I'd make a website and just sent it to everybody. Thanks for coming to Atlanta for my graduation, I hope you enjoyed the city I've been living in for the past 5.5 years!

Samson	Lai	Hey Samson, <br> &emsp; No time to write out all my Christmas cards this year, so typing them out will have to do! It's been a fun 4 years at GATech hanging out with you. Thanks for literally being my partner in crime when I wanted to do any random stuff. I look forward to being able to hang out with you in the future, but until then, best of luck with any and all your future endeavors!
Jeff	Wong	Hi Jeff/Wenny, <br> &emsp; It's been just a bit more lonely in my last year in GA without both of you guys to hang out with. But I hope you both have been enjoying Portland and the DINK (Double Income, No Kids) life! Best wishes for the upcoming year and stay warm!

Samantha	Lo	Dr. Lo, <br> &emsp; Congratulations on graduating! It's been a fun, exciting journey with you, getting to hang out at cooking night every random Saturday. I wish you the best in New Jersey for the next part of your journey, and`if you ever visit CA, feel free to give Tiff or I a call!
Brian	Gestner	Dr. Gestner, <br> &esmp; It's been a fun 4-5 years hanging out with you every random Saturday for cooking night. Thank you so much for always bringing beer and taking charge washing the dishes. It is always very much appreciated, as I'm generally super tired by the end of the night. I hope you and Samantha can end the long distance gap soon, but until then, best of luck for all future endeavors! If you ever come to CA, feel free to call Tiff or I up, we would love to hang out!

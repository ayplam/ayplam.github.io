## About

My name is Adrian Lam and I focus on building AI applications that have real world impact. I currently lead a team of data scientists and engineers at Change Healthcare that use AI to automate medical record auditing and have taken what started as a "blue sky idea" to a data science pipeline that processes 100 million medical record pages annually and predicts diagnosis code validity.  

This is my personal website to record parts of my journey as it evolves through the year.
